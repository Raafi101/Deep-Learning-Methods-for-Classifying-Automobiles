# Deep Learning Methods for Classifying Images of Automobiles by Body Style
Used standard machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest, followed by many deep learning models such as a fully connected network, convolutional neural network, and transfer learning using ResNet50. Compared all of the models and concluded the ResNet50 model performed best with a test accuracy of 76.3%. Data set included 6 types of vehicle body styles: multi-purpose vehicles, sports utility vehicles, convertibles, pickups, sedans, and station wagons.

What I Learned: Computer vision best practices, such as the preprocessing of images, how to use trained models through the use of transfer learning.
